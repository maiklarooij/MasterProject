Meanwhile, speaking of wars, on Monday Senator Lindsey Graham -- whose solution to every foreign policy problem boils down to armed conflict -- entered the 2016 race. Right on cue, three days later, responding to a question about the fact that Americans are tired of endless war, Graham said, \"Well don't vote for me.\" Duly noted. It's an odd impulse to constantly want to start wars in the name of democracy while simultaneously undermining it here at home.\n\n"

The key is to prioritize not letting stress turn the holidays from a time of renewal to a time of frenzy. \"Everything changed the day she figured out there was exactly enough time for the important things in her life,\" writes the artist Brian Andreas. So this is the perfect moment -- right before it all starts -- to slow down and reflect on how we can turn a time that so often becomes a time of high anxiety into a time of generosity, celebration, and coming together.\n\nID: 10\nTitle: Justin Williams' Stanley Cup Celebration Features Marriage Proposal\nCategory: WEDDINGS\nDescription: Click through the slideshow below to see other crazy and cute proposals.

Since the Americans destroyed the Afghan symbiosis between al-Qaeda and the Taliban, no terror group has achieved anything like this.
