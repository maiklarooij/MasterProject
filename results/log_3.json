In the World Cup, Uruguayan star Luis Suarez avoided using his hands, but not his teeth. For his toddler-worthy meltdown he was banned nine matches and given a four-month time-out. Meanwhile, the U.S. won by losing, advancing to the knockout stage of the tournament even while losing to Germany, thanks to Portugal beating Ghana. The U.S. fell only one goal short of remaining unbeaten, but, unlike Italy, they at least remained unbitten.\n\nID: 8\nTitle: Slain Cameraman Honored\nCategory: CRIME\nDescription: Remembering one of the two victims of the on-air shooting.\n\nID: 9\nTitle: The Unbearable Rudeness of Bibi\nCategory: POLITICS\nDescription: Time and time again, Netanyahu has shown little respect for American presidents, institutions or interests despite the fact that we provide Israel with over $3 billion in aid annually and use our diplomatic capital to block anti-Israeli measures at the United Nations.\n\nID: 10\nTitle: Colorado Gun Restrictions Upheld By Federal Judge\nCategory: POLITICS\nDescription: \n\n"

No matter the outcome of the vote, feeling some measure of control will help keep Greece's spirit alive.\n\nID: 5\nTitle: That Time a Routine Traffic Stop Led a Child Into Foster Care...

It wasn't just the harshness of Sterling's racism that shocked, but also the casualness. The resulting media firestorm reignited questions about the way the league had long turned a blind eye on Sterling's even-more-outrageous history of housing discrimination based on race -- and why the LA chapter of the NAACP was nevertheless on the verge of honoring Sterling with a lifetime achievement award. Meanwhile, on Thursday the Obama administration released a list of 55 higher education institutions under investigation for not adequately handling allegations of sexual assault. The scrutiny and transparency are good first steps but real progress would mean greatly reducing the assaults themselves.
