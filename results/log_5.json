But as Mark Famaner and Hanna Hindstrom point out, it is \"democracy on a leash\" as the long-standing military rulers retain a constraining foothold through the current constitutional arrangement. It remains to be seen if Suu Kyi's elected government will be \"above\" those constraints, as she has boldly asserted. Writing from Yangon, Ma Thida lays out the many issues in the political transition ahead.\n\nHarrison Akins reminds us that the \"shadow\" over Myanmar's democratic turn is the continuing persecution and discrimination against the Muslim Rohingya minority. \n\nIf it stabilizes, Myanmar could have a bright future. It sits between the two fastest growing economies in the world, India and China, the second of which is revitalizing the ancient Silk Road trading route that George Yeo, Singapore's former foreign minister, sees as making Eurasia the driver of the future global economy.

Meanwhile -- irony alert! -- Trump said former Mexican President Vincente Fox \"used a filthy, disgusting word\" and \"should be ashamed.\" Even worse, the substance matched the atmosphere. After an extended debate on poll numbers, it was hard not to wonder how much better it would be if the candidates cared about meaningful data as much as poll data: like the new report that the seas are rising at their fastest rate in 28 centuries. Or that 22 million people would lose healthcare with Obamacare's repeal.
