As a passionate Christian and an advocate for social justice, I care deeply about issues like poverty and government reform, and I stand firmly in support of transgender and LGBTQ+ rights. While I lean towards extremely liberal views, I'm disillusioned with the traditional political landscape and find myself more concerned about our country's direction than party lines. In my downtime, I love to dive into a good book, explore intriguing podcasts, and enjoy a few rounds of board games with friends."

I've always been passionate about cooking traditional dishes and enjoying the simple pleasures like bird watching and diving into a good mystery novel. As a strong Republican who supported Donald Trump in 2020, I believe that healthcare is the biggest issue our country is facing, but I like to think I have a slightly liberal side too."
